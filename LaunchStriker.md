# Launch Striker Privacy Policy (effective 4/25/2023)

Launch Striker only collects any data if consent is granted by the user. Analytics consent can be freely granted or revoked in the settings menu.

The only data Launch Striker collects are general statistics on app usage (including when the app is opened/closed), when general interactions (such as button presses and taps occur), and play statistics (when levels start/end, and what scores users acheive).

Launch Striker does not collect any personally identifiable information.

The data collected is used for the following purposes:
1. To improve the game itself (i.e. analyzing user behavior and watching how it changes over time in response to feature updates)
2. To generate aggregate statistics of play data which may be shared with third parties such as publishers to market or improve the game.

The following permissions are used by Launch Striker on Android:
- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
- INTERNET
- WAKE_LOCK

All permissions are only used to facilitate the functionality of Firebase Analytics.

Data collected can only be associated with any specific user through a specific device ID - all of the data collected is anonymized and not personally identifiable. While this data cannot be deleted, any individual user's device ID can be removed from their device, which essentially removes any connection between that user and the analytics data.

To learn more about how to remove this connection, please contact the developer at `aaron.trudeau@vividreamsoftware.com`, and I will manually remove the application data.
